Curators Guide
==============

**UNDER CONSTRUCTION**: guidelines for `bio.tools <https://bio.tools>`_  curators, including EDAM annotation guidelines.  Please provide comments via `GitHub <https://github.com/bio-tools/biotoolsDocs/issues/6>`_

bio.tools includes all types of bioinformatics *tools* - application software with well-defined data processing functions (inputs, outputs and operations).  This ranges from simple tools with a single primary function, to complex, multimodal tools with many disinct functions.  Tools may be available for immediate use as online services, or in a form which a user can download, install, configure and run themselves.

Each bio.tools entry describes a discrete tool.  The scope, i.e. the types of tools that may be included, and the attributes for their description, are defined in `biotoolsSchema <https://github.com/bio-tools/biotoolsschema>`_.

Guidelines below include:

- `general guidelines <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#general-guidelines>`_ including information about `tool functions <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#id12>`_ and `EDAM annotations <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#id100>`_.  You should read these first of all.
- `guidelines <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#summary>`_ on specific attributes defined in the `biotoolsSchema <https://github.com/bio-tools/biotoolsschema>`_ and organised into sections as they appear in the `bio.tools <https://bio.tools>`_ registration user interface
- `guidelines <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#guidelines-per-tool-type>`_ specific to individual `types of tools <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#tool-type>`_

Individual attribute guidelines are organised as follows:

- **Automatically verified** guidelines are checked as part of automated QC performed periodically by the bio.tools system
- **Manually verified** guidelines are checked as part of manual QC performed by bio.tools admin
- **Tips and notes** are not verified

.. note::
   - entries in which all attributes pass both the automated and manual checks will, in the future, be be labelled as "Verified" (and stamped with data of verification and last update).  For further information, see the emerging `information standard <http://biotoolsschema.readthedocs.io/en/latest/information_requirement.html>`_ for tools being adopted by bio.tools.
   - for curation advice or to make suggestions about these guidelines please add comments via `GitHub <https://github.com/bio-tools/biotoolsDocs/issues/6>`_ or mail `registry-support <mailto:registry-support@elixir-dk.org>`_ directly.
     
General guidelines
------------------

Before you start
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Consider the following *before* creating a bio.tools entry:

1. **Are one or more entries required to describe the software?**

   - `workbenches <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#workbench>`_ and other `suites <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#suite>`_ often require multiple entries.
   - tools with multiple interfaces (*e.g.* `Command-line tool <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#command-line-tool>`_ , `Web API <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#web-api>`_, `Web service <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#web-service>`_ and `Web application <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#web-application>`_) are normally described by a single entry **unless** these interfaces provide fundamental functional differences (operations, inputs and outputs).  
     
   If in doubt, mail `registry-support <mailto:registry-support@elixir-dk.org>`_.  

2. **What tool types apply?**

   - one or more `types <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#tool-type>`_ may be assigned in a single entry reflecting different facets of the software that are described in that entry.
   - read the tool type-specific `guidelines <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#guidelines-per-tool-type>`_.

     
3. **What if the software is already registered?** 

   - if you're the rightful owner of the entry (*i.e.* the tool developer or provider of an online service) then request ownership of it
   - otherwise, request edit rights 

   Make these requests using the buttons at the bottom of the Tool Card). If you plan to register multiple entries *en masse*, please discuss this first with `bio.tools admin <mailto:registry-support@elixir-dk.org>`_.  
     
4. **Are there version-specific considerations?**

   - as a rule, a bio.tools entry describes the *latest version* available at the time of registration and is updated, as required, for subsequent releases.
   - in exceptional circumstances, a new version with fundamental functional differences (operations, inputs and outputs) and can be registered as an entirely new entry.  In such cases, follow carefully the guidelines for tool `name <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#name>`_ and `version <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#version>`_ annotations.

5. **Plan how to describe the tool functions in detail** (see `below <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#tool-functions>`_)
6. **Read the general EDAM annotations guidelines** (see `below <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#edam-annotation-guidelines>`_) before starting.


.. attention::
   The current version of `bio.tools <https://bio.tools/>`_ allows version specification via a discrete component in the Tool Card URL (e.g. https://bio.tools/tool/SignalP/version/4.1).  Version specification will be dropped in the next release (e.g.. https://dev.bio.tools/SignalP), however, it will still be possible to specify the `version <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#id16>`_ of a tool that is being described.

Tool functions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
bio.tools uses a model of software (see below) defined within `biotoolsSchema <https://github.com/bio-tools/biotoolsschema>`_.  A tool can have one or more basic functions (modes of operation), each function performing one or more specific operation (e.g."Sequence alignment"), each of which may have one or more primary inputs and outputs, each of a defined type of data and listing supported format(s).

  
.. image:: tool_function.PNG

Plan how how to describe the software:

- identify the distinct functions (modes of operation) and the individual operations associated with each one.  For well documented tools this is usually obvious.  If in any doubt mail `registry-support <mailto:registry-support@elixir-dk.org>`_.
- as a general rule, if the tool allows an option between doing one thing or another, then annotate these as distinct functions.  If in contrast a tool always does one or more things, then annotate these as distinct operations within a single function
- bio.tools aims for fairly coarse-grained description, *i.e.* specify the primary functions and operations, from a typical end-user perspective; if in doubt mail `registry-support <mailto:registry-support@elixir-dk.org>`_
- this holds for input and output too, *e.g.* a sequence alignment tool would be annotated as reading sequences (input), and writing a sequence alignment (output), but not with gap insertion and extension penalties, or other parameters.



EDAM annotations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The `EDAM ontology <http://edamontologydocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ is used to annotate applicable `topics <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#topic>`_, `operations <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#operation>`_, and the `type <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#data-type-input-and-output-data>`_ and `format <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#data-format-input-and-output-data>`_ of inputs and outputs. Follow these general guidelines:

- if you're struggling to find the terms you need, or the meaning of a term is not obvious, search EDAM using the browsers below (they have different functionalities).  Multiple searches using synonyms, alternative spellings *etc.* can help.

  - `EBI OLS browser <http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/edam>`_
  - `NCBO BioPortal browser <https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/EDAM>`_

- pick the most specific term(s) available, bearing in mind some concepts are necessarily overlapping or general.
- in case more than sibling term is applicable (*i.e.* terms under a common parent) than consider using parent term instead.
- if you cannot find the right term, request it’s added to EDAM via `GitHub <https://github.com/edamontology/edamontology/issues/new>`_ but first read the guidelines on `how to request a term <http://edamontologydocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributors_guide.html#requests>`_.

.. attention::
   - in cases of multiple annotations per field, **do not** specify both a term and it's parent or other ancestor
   - **do not** use top-level EDAM concepts *e.g.* Topic of "Topic" or Operation of "Operation"


.. note::
   It takes some time from requesting new EDAM terms for these to be supported in bio.tools.  In future, you'll be able to request terms directly via the bio.tools registration interface and these terms will become immediately available for use, albeit subject to approval and inclusion in EDAM.

Attribute guidelines
--------------------
     
Summary
^^^^^^^

Name
....
**Canonical software name assigned by the software developer or service provider**

*e.g.* **"SignalP"**

.. note:: The name has a 100 character limit and may only contain uppercase and lowercase letters, decimal digits, spaces, periods, commas, dashes, colons, plus symbols, semicolons and parentheses

**Manually verified**

- use the name in common use, *i.e.* in the tool homepage and publication.
- use the short form of the name *e.g.* ``ExPASy`` **not** ``ExPASy Bioinformatics Resource Portal``.
- preserve capitalisation *e.g.* ``ExPASy`` **not** ``expasy``.
- for database portals, use the pattern ``name (acronym)`` *e.g.* ``The Protein Databank (PDB)``.  A common abbreviation can be given instead of an acronym.  If there is no common acronym or abbreviation, omit this part (**do not** invent one!)  

- for software that essentially just wraps or provides an interface to some other tool, *e.g.* a `web application <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#id123>`_ over an existing tool, and also for `Web APIs <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#id125>`_ (REST), `Web services <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#id133>`_ (SOAP+WSDL), use the pattern:

  ``toolName {API|WS}{( wrapperName)}``

  using ``API`` for Web APIs, ``WS`` for Web services and where ``wrapperName`` is the name of some institute, workbench, collection *etc.*.  For example ``abiview WS (husar)``.  **Do not** misappropriate the original name!  See the description of `tool types <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#tool-type>`_.

- **do not** include version information *unless* this is part of the name in common use in the tool homepage and publication.  In exceptional cases (*i.e.* when registering, as separate entries, versions of a tool which have distrinct functionality), use the pattern

  ``toolname (version versionID)``

  where ``versionID`` is the version number, *e.g.* ``FindPeaks (version 3.1)``
     

**Automatically verified**

- for `Web APIs <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#id125>`_ (REST) and `Web services <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#id133>`_ (SOAP+WSDL) include ``API`` or ``WS`` respectively, as per the pattern ``toolName {API|WS} (wrapperName)`` (see above).
- **do not** include general or technical terms such as "software", "application", "server", "service", "SOAP", "REST", "RESTful" *etc.* unless these are part of the common name
     
.. tip::
   - in case of mulitple related entries be consistent, *e.g.* ``Open PHACTS`` and ``Open PHACTS API``
   - be wary of names that are very long (>25 characters); in exceptional circumstances, if shortening the name is necessary, **do not** truncate within a word and ensure the name remains intuitive
   - to register versions of a tool as separate entries; see the notes on `Tool version <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#tool-versions>`_.
  


ID
..
**Unique ID of the tool that is assigned upon registration of the software in bio.tools**

*e.g.* **signalp**

.. note::
   - the ID is a URL-safe derivative of (often identical to) the tool name restricted to 12 characters maximum.  Unreserved characters (uppercase and lowercase letters, decimal digits, hyphen, period, underscore, and tilde) are allowed. All other characters including reserved characters and other characters deemed unsafe are not allowed. Spaces are preserved as underscore ("_").
   - once set, the ID can only be changed by bio.tools admin!
   - the ID is used in the Tool Card URLs, *e.g.* https://bio.tools/tool/signalp
   - the 12 char limit is not currently enforced by bio.tools and will be increased in the next release of `biotoolsSchema <https://github.com/bio-tools/biotoolsschema>`_.

**Manually verified**

- the ID should be clean and intuitive: where possible, simply use the default (a URL-safe version of the tool name)
- **do not** truncate the name (in the middle of a word, or at all) if this renders the ID ugly or meaningless

**Automatically verified**

- replace ' ' (spaces) in the name with underscores (a single underscore in case of multiple spaces)
- preserve all reserved characters (uppercase and lowercase letters, decimal digits, hyphen, period, underscore, and tilde), but remove other characters
- use '_' to delimit parts of names but only *if* these are not already truncated in the original `name <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#id123>`_
- for Web APIs and Web services, use the pattern ``toolName_{API|WS}_wrapperName)`` as per guideline for `name <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#name>`_ above, *e.g.* ``abiview_WS_husar``.
     


Version
.......
**Version (typically a version number) of the software assigned by the software developer or service provider.**

*e.g.* **4.1**

.. note:: The version has a 100 character limit and may only contain uppercase and lowercase letters, decimal digits, period, comma, dash, colon, plus symbol, semicolon and parentheses.

**Manually verified**

- specify exactly the version label in common use
- for database portals and web applications, only specify a version if this is used in the original `name <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#name>`_
- **do not** include labels such as "v", "ver", "version", "rel", "release" *etc.*, *unless* these are part of the public version label

.. important::
   The version specified indicates which version of the tool is described by other attributes in the entry: **only** change the version

     - if you're sure there's no fundamental change to the specified tool `functions <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#function>`_ (operations, inputs and outputs)
     - or if there are fundamental changes, update the tool `function <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#function>`_ annotation
  
.. attention::
   - **do not** assume version "1" in case the version number is not readily findable

  
  
Description
...........
**Short and concise textual description of the software function**

*e.g.* **"Prediction of the presence and location of signal peptide cleavage sites in amino acid sequences from different organisms."**

.. note:: Description is minimum 10 and maximum 200 characters

**Manually verified**
	  
- use declarative sentences (ideally a single sentence!) in the present tense
- provide only a terse statement of the tool function: what is done not how: this can include the primary operation(s) and possibly the types of primary input and output data
- ensure no ugly mid-word truncations
- **do not** include any of the following:

  - technical terms describing the type of software
  - details about the software provider *e.g.* institute or person name
  - statements about how good the software is (although mentions of applicability are OK)
       
**Automatically verified**

- begin with a capital letter and end with a '.': 
- **do not** include any of the following:

   - tool name
   - URLs
  

Homepage
........
**Homepage of the software, or some URL that best serves this purpose**

*e.g.* **http://cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/**

.. note::
   A valid URL is specified.

**Manually verified**

- the URL should resolve to a web page of information specific to the software: **do not** specify a general URL such as an institutional homepage

.. tip:: In case a tool lacks it's own website, URL of it's code repository is OK


Collection
..........
**Unique ID of a collection that the software has been assigned to within bio.tools.**

*e.g.* **CBS**

.. note::
   - the ID is a URL-safe name restricted to 12 characters maximum.  Unreserved characters (uppercase and lowercase letters, decimal digits, hyphen, period, underscore, and tilde) are allowed. All other characters including reserved characters and other characters deemed unsafe are not allowed.
   - the 12 char limit is not currently enforced by bio.tools and will be increased in the next release of `biotoolsSchema <https://github.com/bio-tools/biotoolsschema>`_.

**Manually verified**

- keep it short and intuitive

.. tip::
   - `biotoolsSchema <https://github.com/bio-tools/biotoolsschema>`_ allows tool relationships to be defined, but these are not yet supported in bio.tools.  In the meantime, collections may be used to group together related entries.
   - collections may be created for for any arbitrary purpose
     

Function
^^^^^^^^

Operation
.........
**The basic operation(s) performed by the software**

*e.g.* **'Protein signal peptide detection' (http://edamontology.org/operation_0418)**

- specify the primary operations performed by this function of the tool

.. note::
   - an EDAM Operation concept URL and / or term are specified, *e.g.* "Multiple sequence alignment", http://edamontology.org/operation_0492.

     
Data type (input and output data)
.................................
**Type of primary input / output data (if any)**

*e.g.* **'Sequence' (http://edamontology.org/data_2044)**

.. note::
   - an EDAM Data concept URL and / or term are specified, *e.g.* "Protein sequences", http://edamontology.org/data_2976. 

Data format (input and output data)
...................................
**Allowed format(s) of primary inputs/outputs**

*e.g.* **'FASTA' (http://edamontology.org/format_1929)**

.. note::
   - an EDAM Format concept URL and / or term are specified, *e.g.* "FASTA", http://edamontology.org/format_1929.

.. tip::
   - many tools allow a primary input to be specified in a number of alternative ways, the common case being a sequence input that may be specified via a sequence identifier, or by typing in a literal sequence.  In such cases, annotate the input using the EDAM Data concept for the type of data, not the identifier.
     
Comment
.......
**Concise comment about this function, if not apparent from the software description and EDAM annotations.**

*e.g.* ****

Tool type guidelines
--------------------

Command-line tool
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
**A tool with a text-based (command-line) interface.**

Database portal
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
**A Web application, suite or workbench providing a portal to a biological database.**

Desktop application
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
**A tool with a graphical user interface that runs on your desktop environment, e.g. on a PC or mobile device.**

Library
^^^^^^^
**A collection of components that are used to construct other tools. bio.tools scope includes component libraries performing high-level bioinformatics functions but excludes lower-level programming libraries.**

Ontology
^^^^^^^^
**A collection of information about concepts, including terms, synonyms, descriptions etc.**

- pick one or more `topics <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#topic>`_ that best describe the scientific areas covered by the ontology
- pick the `operation <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#operation>`_ of "Query and retrieval" (http://edamontology.org/operation_0224)
- do not annotate the type or format of the input and output data
  
Plug-in
^^^^^^^
**A software component encapsulating a set of related functions, which are not standalone, i.e. depend upon other software for its use, e.g. a Javascript widget, or a plug-in, extension add-on etc. that extends the function of some existing tool.**

.. note::
   - `biotoolsSchema <https://github.com/bio-tools/biotoolsschema>`_ allows tool relationships to be defined, but these are not yet supported in bio.tools.  In future, the ``isPluginFor`` relationship will allow specification of the tool to which the plug-in is applicable.
   
Script
^^^^^^
**A tool written for some run-time environment (e.g. other applications or an OS shell) that automates the execution of tasks. Often a small program written in a general-purpose languages (e.g. Perl, Python) or some domain-specific languages (e.g. sed).**

SPARQL endpoint
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
**A service that provides queries over an RDF knowledge base via the SPARQL query language and protocol, and returns results via HTTP.**

- pick one or more `topics <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#topic>`_ that best describe the underyling data
- pick the `operation <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#operation>`_ of "Query and retrieval" (http://edamontology.org/operation_0224)
- do not annotate the type or format of the input and output data

.. note::
   - `biotoolsSchema <https://github.com/bio-tools/biotoolsschema>`_ allows tool relationships to be defined, but these are not yet supported in bio.tools.  In future, the ``isInterfaceTo`` relationship will allow specification of the data resource (database portal) that a SPARQL endpoint provides an interface to.
     
Suite
^^^^^
**A collection of tools which are bundled together into a convenient toolkit. Such tools typically share related functionality, a common user interface and can exchange data conveniently. This includes collections of stand-alone command-line tools, or Web applications within a common portal.**

- describe the attributes of the suite as a whole, not (typically) individual tools or functions provided by it
- individual tools included in the suite should be registered as separate entries
- when annotating the `operation <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#operation>`_ of the suite, pick one or two of the primary operation(s) of the included tools
- entries for the suite itself and it's component tools can be associated by annotatong them as part of a common `collection <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#collection>`_

.. tip:: If you are considering to register a suite with many tools, it is a good idea to discuss this first with the `bio.tools admin <mailto:registry-support@elixir-dk.org>`_.
	 
.. note::
   - `biotoolsSchema <https://github.com/bio-tools/biotoolsschema>`_ allows tool relationships to be defined, but these are not yet supported in bio.tools.  In future, the ``includes`` relationship will allow specification of the tools that are included in a suite.

.. attention:: **do not** annotate the `type <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#data-type-input-and-output-data>`_ and `format <>`_ of input and output data, *unless* all tools in the suite happen to have these in common

Web application
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
**A tool with a graphical user interface that runs in your Web browser.**



.. note::
   - `biotoolsSchema <https://github.com/bio-tools/biotoolsschema>`_ allows tool relationships to be defined, but these are not yet supported in bio.tools.  In future, the ``isInterfaceTo`` and ``uses`` relationships will allow specification of the tools that a web application provides an interface to or uses.

   - for software that essentially just wraps or provides an interface to some other tool, *e.g.* a web application or web service over an existing tool, use the pattern ``toolName providerName`` where ``providerName`` is a name (without spaces) of some institute, workbench, collection *etc.*, *e.g.* ``cufflinks cloudIFB``.  **Do not** misappropriate the original name!     

     
Web API
^^^^^^^
**An application programming interface (API) consisting of endpoints to a request-response message system accessible via HTTP. Includes everything from simple data-access URLs to RESTful APIs.**

- in general, describe the attributes of the API as a whole, not individual endpoint of the API (see note below)
- in case the API has a single endpoint only, the input(s), operation(s) and output(s) may be annotated
- in case the API has many endpoints, annotate the primary operation(s), but **not** the inputs and outputs
- annotate the location of machine-readable API specification (*e.g.* openAPI file) using the `download <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#download>`_ attribute with `download type <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#download-type>`_ of ``API specification``
  - annotate the location of any human-readable documentation using the `documentation <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#documentation>`_ attribute with `documentation type <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#download-type>`_ of ``API specification``
- when assigning the `name <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#name>`_, use the pattern ``name API`` *e.g.* ``Open PHACTS API``
- in case the web service provides an interface to an existing tool registered in bio.tools, try to ensure the relevant annotations are consistent

.. note::
   - `biotoolsSchema <https://github.com/bio-tools/biotoolsschema>`_ includes a basic model of an API specification including endpoints however this is not yet supported in bio.tools
   - `biotoolsSchema <https://github.com/bio-tools/biotoolsschema>`_ allows tool relationships to be defined, but these are not yet supported in bio.tools.  In future, the ``isInterfaceTo`` relationship will allow specification of the tool or data resource (database portal) that the web service provides an interface to.
     
Web service
^^^^^^^^^^^
**An API described in a machine readable form (typically WSDL) providing programmatic access via SOAP over HTTP.**

- in general, describe the attributes of the web service as a whole, not individual endpoint of the service (see note below)
- in case the web service has a single endpoint only, the input(s), operation(s) and output(s) may be annotated
- in case the web service has many endpoints, annotate the primary operation(s), but **not** the inputs and outputs
- annotate the location of the WSDL file using the `download <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#download>`_ attribute with `download type <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#download-type>`_ of ``API specification``
- annotate the location of any human-readable documentation using the `documentation <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#documentation>`_ attribute with `documentation type <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#download-type>`_ of ``API specification``
- when assigning the `name <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#name>`_, use the pattern ``name WS`` *e.g.* ``EMMA WS``
- in case the web service provides an interface to an existing tool registered in bio.tools, try to ensure the relevant annotations are consistent

.. note::
   - `biotoolsSchema <https://github.com/bio-tools/biotoolsschema>`_ includes a basic model of an API specification including endpoints however this is not yet supported in bio.tools
   - `biotoolsSchema <https://github.com/bio-tools/biotoolsschema>`_ allows tool relationships to be defined, but these are not yet supported in bio.tools.  In future, the ``isInterfaceTo`` relationship will allow specification of the tool that the web service provides an interface to

Workbench
^^^^^^^^^
**An application or suite with a graphical user interface, providing an integrated environment for data analysis which includes or may be extended with any number of functions or tools. Includes workflow systems, platforms, frameworks etc.**

- describe the attributes of the workbench as a whole, not (typically) individual tools or functions provided by it
- individual tools included in the workbench, especially where these tools are indepepdently available, should be registered as separate entries
- individual functions provided by the workbench, especially where these are not independently available, should each be described in their own `function <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#function>`_
- entries for the workbench itself and it's component tools can be associated by annotatong them as part of a common `collection <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#collection>`_

.. tip:: If you are considering to register a complicated workbench with many tools or functions, it is a good idea to discuss this first with the `bio.tools admin <mailto:registry-support@elixir-dk.org>`_.
	 
.. note::
   - `biotoolsSchema <https://github.com/bio-tools/biotoolsschema>`_ allows tool relationships to be defined, but these are not yet supported in bio.tools.  In future, the ``includes`` relationship will allow specification of the tools that are included in a workbench.

Workflow
^^^^^^^^
**A set of tools which have been composed together into a pipeline of some sort. Such tools are (typically) standalone, but are composed for convenience, for instance for batch execution via some workflow engine or script.**

- when deciding how to annotate a workflow inputs, operations and outputs, consider the worfklow as a "black box" , *i.e.* annotate the input(s) to, output(s) from and primary operation(s) of the workflow as a whole
  
.. note::
   - `bio.tools <https://bio.tools>`_ does not currently contain many examples of workflows.  We welcome input on how to describe worfklows and ensure good coverage:  please `get in touch with us <mailto:registry@elixir-dk.org>`_.
   - `biotoolsSchema <https://github.com/bio-tools/biotoolsschema>`_ allows tool relationships to be defined, but these are not yet supported in bio.tools.  In future, the ``includes`` relationship will allow specification of the tools that are included in a workflow.  

.. important:: workflows can contain many tools; **do not** list all the operations performed by these tools, just the main operation(s) of the workflow as a whole.
